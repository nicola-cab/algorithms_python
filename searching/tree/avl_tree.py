        Implementation for avl binary search tree.
        The avl binary search tree is binary tree that guarantees lg N time for insert/find/delete.
        The avl tree use rotation coupled with height analysis between nodes in order to accomplish balancing
        
        Important:
            - this implementation uses massively recursion. 
            - Probably in practise you will never need this stuff
